* Payment Gateway


** Getting started

*** Prerequisites

- [[https://hurl.dev][hurl]] :: CLI tool that runs http requests, similar to curl
- [[https://docs.docker.com/desktop/][docker :: ]] Using docker to run project and mocks
- [[https://jqlang.org/][jq]] :: (Optional) CLI tool to query JSON data

*** Usage

Run the project with both providers mocked:

#+begin_src shell
docker compose up
#+end_src

The docker compose file is configured to build and run 3 dockers, 2 being the mocked providers (Stripe and Braintree), they're both were created using [[https://github.com/mrak/stubby4node][stubby4node]] and the project.
The main project will use port =8000= in your machine and the providers will use port =8001= and =8002= (this is mostly for running the main project outside docker).

In other terminal, make the request with hurl

#+begin_src shell
hurl request.hurl
#+end_src

In case you want to see the response with json format, you can use jq

#+begin_src shell
hurl request.hurl | jq .
#+end_src
