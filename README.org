** Getting started

*** Prerequisites

- [[https://hurl.dev][hurl]] :: CLI tool that runs http requests, similar to curl
- [[https://docs.docker.com/desktop/][docker :: ]] Using docker to run project and mocks
- [[https://just.systems/][just]] ::  CLI runner
- [[https://jqlang.org/][jq]] :: (Optional) CLI tool to query JSON data

If you're using nix, you can find a flake in the root of the project and run =nix develop= to download all the tools (or allow [[https://direnv.net/][direnv]] to auto import in your path)

*** Usage

Run docker compose to start mocks, the mocks will use ports =8002= and =8003= and the were created using [[https://github.com/mrak/stubby4node][stubby4node]]

#+begin_src shell
docker compose up
#+end_src

In another terminal, bulid and run the project with =just=, it will start the project in port =8000=

#+begin_src shell
just run
#+end_src

In other terminal, make the request with hurl

#+begin_src shell
hurl request.hurl
#+end_src

In case you want to see the response with json format, you can use jq

#+begin_src shell
hurl request.hurl | jq .
#+end_src

** Tests

To run all tests, you can run the command that it will run all tests from the project:

#+begin_src shell
just test
#+end_src
